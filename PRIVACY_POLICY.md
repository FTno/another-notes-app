# Privacy Policy

Another Notes App is an open source app developped by Nicolas Maltais, who 
shall be referred as "the developer" in this text. This SERVICE is provided by
the developer at no cost and is intended for use as is. 

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, 
use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of 
information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect 
is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your 
information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and
Conditions, which is accessible at Another Notes App unless otherwise defined in 
this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide 
us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited 
to your email address and synchronized notes data. 

The collection of this information will only happen if you create an account for 
the Service and enable the synchronization and backup of your notes data to the 
Cloud. This information will be retained on a server until the deletion of your
account. Synchronized notes data will only be retained as long as it is present
on your device, provided that an Internet connection is available and that the 
app has proceeded to a synchronization after the deletion of this data.

The developer will not use any of this information to another end than providing
synchronization functionality. Your data will also be encoded to a format that
is not human-readable (base64) when on the server. This measure is taken in
order to prevent accidental eavesdropping, but is in no way a security measure 
in case of server data breach.

The app also use third party services that may collect information used to 
identify you. Links to privacy policy of third party service providers used by 
the app:

- [Google Play Services][google-play-services-privacy] privacy policy
- [Privacy and Security in Firebase][firebase-privacy]: 
specifically, this Service uses Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime 
Database components of the Firebase SDK.

### Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in 
the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your 
phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device 
Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the 
configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your 
use of the Service, and other statistics.

### Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous 
unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you 
visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use 
third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and 
improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these 
cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to 
refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

### Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

- To facilitate our Service;
- To provide the Service on our behalf;
- To perform Service-related services; or
- To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to 
your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them 
on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the 
information for any other purpose.

### Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are 
striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember 
that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic 
storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute 
security.

### Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party 
link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are 
not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy 
Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility 
for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or 
services.

### Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly 
collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I 
immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and 
you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please 
contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to 
review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes 
by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2020-04-22.
